# Packages
Here, we have a few custom packages. At some point, this will merge with my NUR repo; though that is one of a long list of TODOs here.

Currently, I have the following packages here:
- `lsp-rooter-nvim` which is a Neovim plugin to automatically set the CWD using LSP. The Nixpkgs Vim plugin is broken ATM, and I'll use it to add the plugin once it works.
