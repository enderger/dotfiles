title: Hardware
---

The hardware configuration is used to define hardware-specific properties such as networking and filesystem configuration.

# Naming
I've chosen to name the hardware after rockets, with the idea that the hardware "launches" the system. This makes more sense when taking into account the naming schemes of systems and users.

# Systems
- [Soyuz](./hardware/soyuz.md) : My daily driver PC
- [Little Joe](./hardware/little-joe.md) : A virtual test bed

# Modules
- [Broadcom](./hardware/modules/broadcom.md) : Support for Broadcom WL in network configuration
- [GRUB](./hardware/modules/grub.md) : Makes GRUB use UEFI by default
- [Interface](./hardware/modules/interface.md) : Provides a means to state configured hardware to systems
- [PipeWire](./hardware/modules/pipewire.md) : Configures PipeWire with a few defaults
