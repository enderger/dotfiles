The system configuration is used to define system-wide configurations based on available hardware. 

# Naming
I've named these configurations after the different space programs of world history, with the idea that each "mission" consists of a "rocket" to launch on, a "program" to work on, and a "crew" to perform. The system thusly should be a minimal, hardware-independent base upon which users can build an environment to use.
